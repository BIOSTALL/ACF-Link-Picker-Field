Adds an Advanced Custom Field field that allows the selection of a link utilising the WordPress link picker modal dialog

== Description ==

This add on for the already established Advanced Custom Fields plugin adds a new field type called 'Link Picker' which allows the user to enter a URL, or select from the existing pages. It is a thin wrapper around the link selector included with the WYSIWYG field editor.

This plugin is forked from the plugin of the same name hosted at https://github.com/BIOSTALL/ACF-Link-Picker-Field. This version is hosted at https://github.com/ahebrank/ACF-Link-Picker-Field and issues and PRs should be submitted there.

Note: Advanced Custom Fields must be installed for this add-on to work.

== Compatibility ==

This ACF field type is compatible with:

*	ACF 5
*	ACF 4

== Installation ==

1. Copy the `acf-link_picker` folder into your `wp-content/plugins` folder
2. Activate the 'Advanced Custom Fields: Link Picker' plugin via the plugins admin page
3. Create a new field via ACF and select the Link Picker type

== Usage ==

When outputting the link selection on the front end, you will have three object elements available:

*	url - The URL of the page
*	title - The title of the link, if entered
*	target - Will be either a blank string or '_blank', depending on whether the user has ticked the box for the link to open in a new window/tab.

Code example:

`$mylink = get_field('mylink');`
`var_dump($mylink);`

Outputs:

`array(3) {
  ["url"]=>
  string(31) "http://mysite.com/selected/url/"
  ["title"]=>
  string(10) "Link Title"
  ["target"]=>
  string(6) "_blank"
}`
